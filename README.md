# Java Concert App

The radio station decided to hold a concert at the request of radio listeners. The concert program should include the most popular songs, according to radio listeners. To assess the popularity of the songs and form the concert program, it was decided to create a server on which listeners could offer certain songs to the concert program and give their assessments. Based on the results of these proposals and evaluations, a program will be formed.
